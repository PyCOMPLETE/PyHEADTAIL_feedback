    "Because pickup(s) and kicker(s) are often located in different locations in the accelerator and there is a delay between pickup reading and correction kick, betatron motion of a bunch is an essential part of a feedback system. However, because the betatron motion correction algorthms work usually quite well, implementations of a turn delay or a separate pickup and kicker into the feedback model does not often affect simulation results if a simplified model for a damper system is used and the gain value is low. \n",

Betatron phase advance of one turn delay is much longer than the physical separation of the pickup and the kicker and, therefore, the feedback model can be often simplified by taking only into account the one turn delay between the pickup reading and the correction kick instead of implementing a separate pickup and kicker into the model\n",
